Pip, a young squirrel with a tail that twitched with anticipation, scampered through the undergrowth. But as he scurried past a group of grumpy-looking badgers, he overheard something troubling.  \"We'll trip the runners,\" one badger grumbled. \"And hide the acorns for the acorn toss!\"  Pip gasped. They were going to sabotage the games!  He raced to find Barnaby, the wise old owl. \"Barnaby!

To his surprise, Rosie's nose twitched with determination. \"We need Bruno,\" she declared. \"He's strong!\" Bruno, a gentle giant of a bear, took some convincing. But Rosie’s fiery spirit won him over.  \"We also need a clever plan,\" Bruno rumbled.  \"Which means we need Flicker!\" Flicker, a quick-witted fox, listened intently as Pip explained their predicament.

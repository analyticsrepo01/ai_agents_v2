Examples include berries, apples, bananas, pineapple, spinach, tomatoes, cucumbers, broccoli, and sweet potatoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Fuel for Workouts and Muscle Recovery:** The plan includes meals and snacks timed around workout sessions.  Carbohydrates like quinoa, brown rice, whole grain toast, and oatmeal provide energy for the workouts, while the protein supports muscle recovery and growth.  The snacks (yogurt, nuts, fruit, hummus) offer additional fuel and help prevent excessive hunger.  \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Potential Improvements:** While the plan is good, consider adding some healthy fats to the snacks to improve satiety and provide sustained energy.
